# ScoreFace

This program was written as part of JCT's Hackathon.
The app grades quality of facial images,
based on a neurons network that was trained on a large data set of images divided into several categories.
The program gives the user feedback if the image was good, and if not what the problem was.
The neurons network training was performed using the Tensorflow library.
